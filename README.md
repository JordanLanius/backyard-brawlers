# Backyard Brawlers

Backyard Brawlers is a 2.5D (3D environment with 2D sprites) beat-em-up style game I developed for the UMSL *Video Game Design and Development* class.

It is currently in a working state yet unfinished. I want to continue to work on this project until it is completed. However, this game is low on my list of priorities, so updates will be rare.

## Objective

Traverse to the end of the street without being knocked out by bullies.

## Gameplay

The player moves the fighter from yard to yard. Each yard has a clear condition that must be met before the gate to the next yard opens. The first yard (Yard 0) has a free clear that opens the gate after a second has passed. The other two yards require all enemies to faint before allowing access to the next yard. Enemies wonâ€™t move unless the player is in the same yard and faint after being hit 3 times.

## Controls

- WASD and Arrow Keys: Move the fighter
- Space: Punch
- Escape: Pause the game and open the menu
